# Pima Indian Diabetes
 PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset using Ensemble Learning and Voting Classifiers

All models were more accurate than 70% of the time. For both the
train/test split and the K-fold cross-validation methods, RF and ET
provided roughly 72â€“75 % accuracy.

With an accuracy rate of roughly 75%, the RF is regarded the most effi
cient and promising of all the developed models for studying diabetes.

I used grid search in exercise 4 which is a method of
hyperparameter tuning that builds and evaluates a model methodically
for each combination of algorithm parameters supplied in a grid.

The Pimas, like many other American Indian, have a high prevalence
of diabetes and its associated disabling or fatal consequences, and
would benefit from additional research into the disease's pathogenesis
and prevention.
